Python is widely used in many different domains because of its flexibility
and large ecosystem of libraries.

In web development, Python is used with frameworks such as Django and
Flask to build secure and scalable web applications.

Python plays a major role in data science and data analysis. Libraries
like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib help in data manipulation, analysis,
and visualization.

In the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Python is
the most popular language. Frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and
scikit-learn are commonly used to build intelligent systems.

Python is also used for automation and scripting. Developers write Python
scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as file management, testing,
and system monitoring.

Another important use case is game development. Python libraries like
Pygame allow developers to create simple games and prototypes.

Because Python is easy to learn and powerful, it is often chosen for
education and rapid prototyping.
